# MURMUR v1.2 Mesh Control Protocol

MURMUR is the control channel used between gateways and guest nodes in the
Halcyon industrial mesh. This note is the fielded v1.2 profile. It is enough to
read a link if you already hold a tap position on one.

## 1. Handshake

MURMUR runs a Noise `XKpsk3` handshake with the `25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s`
suite. The gateway is the responder and carries a fixed static key. Guest nodes
are the initiator and bring a fresh ephemeral key for every session, so link
transcripts are never reusable across sessions.

Gateway static public key (baked into every node image):

```
15e8896ef9b0d92253ba8e4f8b96d8600648a4b4f2f299ae1a4ece8c6db71b16
```

The suite hash is a self contained BLAKE2s. It is shipped inline in
`murmur_crypto.py`; treat that file as the reference for every primitive on the
wire. The handshake is three messages:

```
-> e, es
<- e, ee
-> s, se, psk
```

After the second message both peers hold the same transcript hash `h2`. `h2` is
a function of public transcript bytes only (protocol name, the gateway static
public key, both ephemeral public keys, and the two handshake ciphertexts), so a
passive observer can recompute it without any key material. See
`SymmetricState` and `Handshake` in `murmur_crypto.py`.

## 2. Framing

Transport runs after the handshake. Each frame is:

```
[ masked_len : 2 bytes LE ] [ body : masked_len bytes ]
body = [ type : 1 byte ] [ AEAD(payload) ]
```

`masked_len` is the true body length XOR a per frame 16 bit mask:

```
mask_i = LE16( BLAKE2s( h2 || "MURMUR-len" || LE32(i) ) )
```

`i` counts frames from zero, independently per direction. A frame body is never
visible in the clear without `h2` and the suite BLAKE2s, so a stock Noise stack
cannot even find frame boundaries on this profile.

Frame types:

- `0x00` DATA
- `0x01` CONTROL

The AEAD is standard ChaCha20-Poly1305 (RFC 8439). The additional data is the
single type byte. The nonce is `0x00000000 || LE64(counter)` where `counter` is
the per direction message counter. Under the v1.2 profile the counter advances
once per transport message. Payloads are followed by a variable run of zero
padding whose length is chosen by the sender and is not signalled in the clear.

## 3. Telemetry (DATA)

Guest nodes and gateways both emit a fixed status blob as a DATA payload. Layout
is 64 bytes:

```
offset  size  field
0       7     magic  "MURMUR\x12"
7       4     seq            LE u32
11      8     uptime         LE u64
19      2     link_rssi      LE i16
21      2     queue_depth    LE u16
23      16    node_id  "NODE-GUEST-0001\x00"
39      25    reserved (zero)
```

See `build_telemetry` in `murmur_crypto.py`.

## 4. CONTROL

A CONTROL frame with an empty payload is a keepalive. A CONTROL frame with a
payload carries a command:

```
[ opcode : 1 ] [ role : 1 ] [ cmd_len : 2 LE ] [ cmd : cmd_len ]
```

- opcode `0x01` PROVISION
- role `0x00` guest, `0x01` admin

The gateway stores a provisioning secret and returns it, as the payload of a
CONTROL response, only when it accepts an authenticated PROVISION command with
role admin. The response payload is:

```
[ opcode 0x02 ] [ secret_len : 2 LE ] [ secret ]
```

Guest nodes never request provisioning.

## 5. Tap interface

Your tap speaks newline delimited JSON over TCP.

On connect you receive, one JSON object per line:

- `{"event":"session", ...}`
- `{"event":"wire","dir":"n2g"|"g2n","data":"<hex>"}` for each chunk seen on the
  link. `n2g` is node to gateway, `g2n` is gateway to node. Chunks are raw wire
  bytes, not pre split into frames.
- `{"event":"ready"}` once the opening traffic has been mirrored.

You may then send commands, one JSON object per line:

- `{"cmd":"inject","data":"<hex>"}` splices raw bytes toward the gateway as its
  next inbound frame. The gateway replies on the `g2n` feed if the frame is
  accepted and triggers a response.
- `{"cmd":"step"}` releases the next buffered node frame toward the gateway.
- `{"cmd":"close"}` ends the session.

Sessions are per team and short lived. Fresh ephemeral keys every time.
